#IGE CONNECTIONS Workspace configuration

This repo holds the config for the [Inclusive Workspace & Dev Resource Hub](https://github.com/igeclouds/spec). The origin is an adoption from the microsoft vscode dev container specification

You may view the site at [igecloud.dev](https://connections.igecloud.dev).

## Building
With the group permission, we have decided to make this public for individual learning and resource to @ecampuslearning

### Dev container

You may build GitHub Pages sites with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is a Ruby gem. You could manually install these tools on your machine, or you can easily get started with the setup you already need through a dev container!

You may review this repo's dev container in the [`.devcontainer`](https://github.com/devcontainers/containers.dev/tree/gh-pages/.devcontainer) folder.

It is from this [Jekyll definition](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/tree/main/containers/jekyll).

### Steps to build and run

* Clone or open this repo in the dev container-supporting editor of your choosing.
     * You may review supporting tools and services [here](https://containers.dev/supporting).
* Reopen this repo in the dev container, so that the container builds and you may develop inside it using the included tools. 
* Once the dev container finishes building, execute the following command in your dev container to start the site: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
* Check out the site! http://localhost:4000/containers.dev/
